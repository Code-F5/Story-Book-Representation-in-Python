# Story-Book-Representation-in-Python
## Built a comic book using Python :      
<p align="left">
</t> Use the main code blocks for your homework in cartoons-with-python-21.ipynb notebook, as well as some of the pictures. You'll have to make the code blocks work together to write a comic book in PDF format that consists of three pages of about 20 images each, with text.
</t> 

<t>All submissions need to be accompanied by the same story in English. In other words, your submission will consist of two pdf files, one with dialogue in your language, and one with dialogues in English. The pictures need to be the same.
</t>

<t>It is recommended to pick one of the themes in the accompanying zip file (miyazaki, monkey king, jungle book, or avengers, family/childrens' book). You may complete them with additional images in the same theme that you download on your own. If you think of a better theme, you may change the theme. Please make sure to approve the theme with the TA's before proceeding.
</t>

<t>You need to write your own text. The comic book needs to be in pdf format (not an image). Each pdf will be of 3 pages minimum with 20 images on each page.   It is a team assignment. However, both team members should have different stories. The Code of the team can be the same, but stories must be different. Both members will be graded individually and need to make individual submissions.     
You're going to use an amazing python library for image processing called pillow, PIL in short.
